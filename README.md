## Plugin Components

Collector's Anxiety is a fully self-contained plugin, meaning that it only exists within the game.

To open the Collector's Anxiety window, either use the `/panxiety` command or use the built-in "open 
settings" button provided by Dalamud in the plugin installer. The Collector's Anxiety window is 
tab-based, with all tracked items appearing as individual tabs.

The **Overview** tab of Collector's Anxiety shows a quick, well, overview of all tracked categories.
This view also will apply parse coloring to each category name, to give players a quick sense of their
progress as well as to encourage just a little bit of toxicity, as a treat. Collection data is not
uploaded to any server, and collection parses are relative to total items collected.

### Installing the Plugin

To install Collector's Anxiety, simply add it through the Dalamud Plugin Installer. Note that, at
this time, this plugin is only available for users with
[Dalamud Testing plugins enabled][dalamudfaq-test]. Upon full release of Collector's Anxiety, it will
be made available to all users.
